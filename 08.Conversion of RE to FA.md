**RE to FA (step-by-step):**  
Break the regular expression into basic parts: `a`, `b`, `ε`, and ∅. Convert each part into a small FA. Then, combine them using rules:

- `R1 + R2`: create a new start and final state with ε-transitions to/from both FAs.
    
- `R1·R2`: connect final state of R1 to start of R2 using ε.
    
- `R*`: add a new start/final state with loops and ε-transitions to repeat the FA. Keep combining until the full FA is built.
