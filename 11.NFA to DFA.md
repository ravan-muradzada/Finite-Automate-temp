While converting NFA to DFA, we need to create a transaction table of NFA first. For the undefined transactions we use fi which is equal to dead state in DFA. Then we need to create the second transaction table for DFA and here for each fi, we need to add a new state (dead state) and then write its transactions.
If any state goes multiple states for an input, we combine them, like if A goes A and B when the input is 1, we create a new state called AB and A goes to AB when the input is 1. After that we try to find the transactions of AB, for that we need to find combination of A and B states. 
Whatever states in the new transaction table contain the letter(s) of the final state of the inital table are our new final states. However it is not the same for initial state, it becomes the same.
