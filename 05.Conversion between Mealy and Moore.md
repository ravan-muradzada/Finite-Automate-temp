### ðŸ§  **How to Convert Between Moore and Mealy Machines**

To **convert a Moore machine to a Mealy machine**, you shift the **output from the state to the transitions**. For each transition in the Moore machine, take the **output of the state you're going to**, and assign it to that transition in the Mealy machine. Since Mealy machines produce output on transitions, the output now depends on the **next stateâ€™s output** from the Moore version. On the other hand, to **convert a Mealy machine to a Moore machine**, you may need to **create more states**. Thatâ€™s because if a state in the Mealy machine has transitions with **different outputs**, youâ€™ll have to **split that state into multiple states** in the Moore version, each with a **fixed output**. Then, adjust the transitions so that the new states behave the same as the Mealy machine but with the output fixed per state (as Moore machines require). The key idea is: Mealy machines are often more compact, while Moore machines may need extra states to keep outputs state-based.

### ðŸ”„ **Converting Moore â†” Mealy from a Transition Table**

#### âœ… **1. Moore to Mealy (State-based Output â†’ Transition-based Output):**

If the transition table is for a **Moore machine**, it will look like this:

|Current State|Input|Next State|**Output (from state)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|q0|a|q1|0|
|q0|b|q2|0|
|q1|a|q1|1|
|...|...|...|...|

To convert this into a **Mealy machine**:

- Take the **output value from the "next state"**, and apply it to the transition.
    
- This is because in Mealy machines, the **transition itself produces output**, and the Moore machineâ€™s output depends on the state **you enter**.
    

So the **Mealy version** of the table becomes:

|Current State|Input|Next State|**Output**|
|---|---|---|---|
|q0|a|q1|**1**|
|q0|b|q2|**0**|
|q1|a|q1|**1**|
|...|...|...|...|

> ðŸŽ¯ **Key Rule**: In Mealy, use the **output of the next state** from Moore.

#### âœ… **2. Mealy to Moore (Transition-based Output â†’ State-based Output):**

If youâ€™re given a **Mealy transition table** like:

|Current State|Input|Next State|Output|
|---|---|---|---|
|q0|a|q1|1|
|q0|b|q2|0|
|q1|a|q1|1|
|q1|b|q2|0|

You **canâ€™t directly assign outputs to states** unless all transitions **into a state have the same output**. If not, youâ€™ll need to:

- **Split the state** into multiple versions, each with a unique output.
    
- For example, if `q1` has transitions into it with both `0` and `1` outputs, you'll split it into `q1_0` and `q1_1` with outputs `0` and `1`, and adjust transitions accordingly.
    

> ðŸŽ¯ **Key Rule**: Moore machines must have **one fixed output per state**, so if transitions go into the same state with different outputs, you must **duplicate the state**.

### ðŸ§  TL;DR Summary:

|From â†’ To|Main Idea|Key Action|
|---|---|---|
|**Moore â†’ Mealy**|Move output from **state to transition**|Use the **output of the next state**|
|**Mealy â†’ Moore**|Move output from **transition to state**|**Duplicate states** if needed to fix outputs|
