First we need to have transaction table. Then we write non-final sets and final sets in seperate sets, so we have 2 sets initially. This is called 0-Equality.
To find 1-Equality, we look at the previous sets and determine whether transaction functions of any two states inside the same set are in the same set. If not, we divide sets. We continue the process up to the end like that. The end previous initial states are inside whatever states now, we call them initial states and the same logic for final sets.
Then we create a new transaction table on the top of the given one. Then it is easier to sketch the graph.
