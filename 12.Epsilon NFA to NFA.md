To be able to that we need to understand what is e*. e* is the set of the states which can be reached from the particular state only using e as input.
We need to find  e* | 0 | e*  for each state and the result is the transaction of the state when the input is 0. For the input 1, we need to find  e* | 1 | e* .

Any state that can reach the final state (in epsilon NFA) are final states in NFA.
