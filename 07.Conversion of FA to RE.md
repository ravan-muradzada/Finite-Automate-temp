**DFA/NFA to Regular Expression (Equation Method):**  
Write one equation per state showing how it's reached using input symbols. The start state includes `ε`. Use substitution to simplify all equations until the **final state** is expressed only in terms of `a`, `b`, and `ε`. Apply **Arden’s Theorem** when needed. The simplified expression for the **final state** is the final regular expression. All other equations are just intermediate steps.

**Multiple Final States in Regex Equation Method:**  
If there are multiple final states, write and simplify the equation for **each final state**. After simplifying, **combine all of them using the `+` (union) operator**, because the automaton accepts strings ending in **any** of the final states. Final regex = sum of simplified expressions for all final states.
